# Soixantesouris

Soixantesouris is a completely useless tool that create an avatar for your mouse on a dedicated website.

## Troubleshooting

After **each** `npm i`, you'll have to [rebuild the modules](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.28.0/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/).

## TODO

- record mouse in Electron
- send mouse position to a server through socket.io
- make a nice website
- add the ability to name your avatar
